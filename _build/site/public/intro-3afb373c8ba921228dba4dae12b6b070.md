# AI Methods for Materials Science

Welcome! This MyST Markdown site is a starting template for the course. It is organized to make it easy to add lectures, readings, assignments, and notebooks as you develop the material.

```{note}
This is a scaffold: replace placeholders with course-specific details as you build out content.
```

## What this course covers

- How modern machine learning and statistical methods accelerate materials discovery.
- Data pipelines: curation, featurization, and validation for chemistry and materials datasets.
- Core models: linear baselines, tree ensembles, Gaussian processes, and neural networks.
- Generative and surrogate modeling for structure/property exploration.
- Automation: connecting ML with simulation workflows and labs.
- Responsible AI: reproducibility, uncertainty, and ethics in scientific AI.

## How to use this template

1. Update `_config.yml` and `myst.yml` with author, logo, and repository links.
2. Add or reorder chapters in `_toc.yml`.
3. Replace module pages in `modules/` with your lecture notes or notebooks.
4. Run `myst start` or `myst build` to preview locally.
