# Foundations: AI for Materials

## Lecture goals

- Frame materials questions as ML problems (regression, classification, generative).
- Understand data types: molecules, crystals, spectra, microstructures.
- Review train/validation/test splits, leakage risks, and evaluation metrics.

## In-class demo

- Baseline property prediction with a small crystal dataset.
- Simple error analysis: parity plots and uncertainty bands.

## Prep work

- Refresh linear algebra (matrix norms, eigen-decomposition).
- Read: overview articles from the resources page.

## Checklist for the instructor

- Verify datasets are cached and licensed.
- Prepare a reproducible environment file (`environment.yml`).
