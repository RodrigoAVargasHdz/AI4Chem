# Syllabus

## Course overview

This course introduces practical AI tools for materials science, blending lectures with hands-on notebooks. Students will learn to frame scientific questions as machine learning and data science tasks, build reliable models, and integrate them with simulation or experimental pipelines.

## Learning objectives

- Formulate materials problems for supervised, unsupervised, and generative modeling.
- Engineer features for molecules, crystals, and microstructures.
- Train, tune, and evaluate models with meaningful uncertainty estimates.
- Design active learning and surrogate modeling loops.
- Apply automation to run and monitor simulations at scale.
- Communicate results with reproducible workflows and documentation.

## Schedule sketch

Week 1: ML foundations for scientific data  
Week 2: Data pipelines and featurization  
Week 3: Linear models, trees, and GPs  
Week 4: Neural networks for materials data  
Week 5: Generative models for structure/property exploration  
Week 6: Active learning and Bayesian optimization  
Week 7: Automation with simulation workflows  
Week 8: Ethics, reproducibility, and project presentations

## Assessment

- Weekly mini-labs (notebooks) focused on a specific dataset or method.
- A midterm checkpoint: model critique and ablation.
- Final project: propose and execute a small AI-for-materials study with a written report and short presentation.

## Policies

- Reproducibility is required: every figure and table must be backed by code and metadata.
- Collaboration is encouraged; attribution and clear division of labor are required.
- Datasets must include provenance and licenses; avoid sharing restricted data.
