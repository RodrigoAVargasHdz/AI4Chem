# Syllabus

## Course overview

This course introduces practical AI tools for materials science, blending lectures with hands-on notebooks. Students will learn to frame scientific questions as machine learning and data science tasks, build reliable models, and integrate them with simulation or experimental pipelines.

## Learning objectives

- Formulate materials problems for supervised, unsupervised, and generative modeling.
- Engineer features for molecules, crystals, and microstructures.
- Train, tune, and evaluate models with meaningful uncertainty estimates.
- Design active learning and surrogate modeling loops.
- Apply automation to run and monitor simulations at scale.
- Communicate results with reproducible workflows and documentation.
