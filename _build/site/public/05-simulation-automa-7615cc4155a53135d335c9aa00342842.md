# Simulation Automation

## Goals

- Connect ML models with simulation workflows (DFT/MD, CALPHAD, phase-field).
- Workflow managers and schedulers: FireWorks, ASE, Atomate, Parsl, or Snakemake.
- Active learning loops: propose → simulate → retrain; logging and monitoring.

## Mini-project idea

- Build a lightweight loop that proposes candidates, calls a placeholder simulator, and updates a surrogate model.
- Track metrics and provenance with an experiment tracker.
