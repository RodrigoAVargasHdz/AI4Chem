# Structure & Property Generation

## Themes

- Generative modeling for molecules and materials: VAEs, diffusion, and autoregressive approaches.
- Property-driven generation and inverse design.
- Evaluation: validity, uniqueness, novelty, property satisfaction.

## Activity

- Walk through a small diffusion-model demo for molecules or a VAE for crystal prototypes.
- Discuss constraints (stoichiometry, symmetry) and how to enforce them.
