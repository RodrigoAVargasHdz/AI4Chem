# Modeling & Learning

## Topics

- Model zoo: linear/elastic net, random forests, gradient boosting, Gaussian processes, simple MLPs.
- Hyperparameter search: grid, random, Bayesian optimization; importance of seeds.
- Uncertainty estimation: ensembles, MC dropout, Gaussian processes.
- Model diagnostics: calibration curves, residual analysis, and feature permutation tests.

## Lab idea

- Train a tree ensemble and a GP on the same dataset; compare uncertainty and calibration.
- Add a simple neural network baseline and discuss overfitting controls (dropout, weight decay, early stopping).
