# Resources

## Core Books

- MyST Markdown / Jupyter Book for publishing notes.
- Python scientific stack: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch/Lightning, ase/pymatgen.
- Workflow and experiment tracking: MLflow/Weights & Biases (pick one), DVC for data versioning.

## Datasets to explore

- Materials Project (crystal structures and properties).
- OQMD (formation energies).
- OC20/OC22 (catalysis).
- QM9 (small molecules), PCQM4Mv2 (graph-based property prediction).
- AFLOW, NOMAD, or any in-house datasets with clear licenses.

## Reading list (starter)

- Butler et al., *Machine Learning for Molecular and Materials Science* (2018).
- Schmidt et al., *Recent Advances and Applications of Machine Learning in Solid-State Materials Science* (2019).
- Xie & Grossman, *Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for an Accurate and Interpretable Prediction of Material Properties* (2018).
- Kingma & Welling, *Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes* (2013) — for generative modeling background.
- Rasmussen & Williams, *Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning* (2006).

## Tips for running the course

- Keep every notebook executable from a clean environment; pin dependencies.
- Include small “toy” datasets for in-class demos; link to large datasets for homework.
- Encourage students to log experiments (hyperparameters, seeds, metrics).
- Set up a shared glossary for key terms and symbols.
