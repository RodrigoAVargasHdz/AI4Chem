# Syllabus

## Course overview

This course introduces practical AI tools for materials science, blending lectures with hands-on notebooks. Students will learn to frame scientific questions as machine learning and data science tasks, build reliable models, and integrate them with simulation or experimental pipelines.

## Learning objectives

- Formulate materials problems for supervised, and unsupervised.
- Engineer features for molecules, crystals, and microstructures.
- Train, tune, and evaluate models.
- Communicate results with reproducible workflows and documentation.

## Schedule

<!-- Week 1: ML foundations for scientific data  
Week 2: Data pipelines and featurization  
Week 3: Linear models, trees, and GPs  
Week 4: Neural networks for materials data  
Week 5: Generative models for structure/property exploration  
Week 6: Active learning and Bayesian optimization  
Week 7: Automation with simulation workflows  
Week 8: Ethics, reproducibility, and project presentations -->

## Final project
Due to the length of the course, the grading will be based on a final project that includes three parts. 
1. **Written Report**, 4 Pages maximum
   1. Page 1: Introduction
   2. Page 2: Methodology
   3. Pages 3-4: Results, Discussion and Summary. 
   4. Extra pages include references, and additional data and results. 
   
2. **Oral Presentation**, 20 min maximum
   1. 20 min long.
   2. Clearly state what is the goal of the project
   3. Methodology description
   4. Some results discussion
   5. Conclusion
   
3. **Code**
   1. Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) deployable in Google Colab. 
   2. It should run smoothly and self-explanatory for other students.
