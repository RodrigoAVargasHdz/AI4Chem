# Data & Featurization

## Focus

- Data hygiene: deduplication, outlier detection, and unit consistency.
- Feature design for molecules (SMILES, graphs), crystals (periodic graphs), and microstructures (images).
- Embeddings from domain libraries: SOAP, CGCNN inputs, SchNet/NequIP representations.
- Splitting strategies that respect chemistry (scaffold, composition, structure-aware splits).

## Hands-on

- Build a featurization pipeline and benchmark a linear baseline versus a tree model.
- Visualize feature importances and sensitivity to measurement noise.

## Optional extension

- Introduce graph neural network inputs using a small dataset.
